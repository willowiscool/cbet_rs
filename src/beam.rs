/// * marked: a list of each spot on the mesh. each list contains the rays that pass through
/// it, stored by their index. It would perhaps be more correct to store the rays in as
/// `Rc<RefCell<Ray>>`, so that marked can own references to the specific rays, and they can
/// still be modified (as crossings are added), but I assume this would also make ray tracing
/// slower, so I think storing the indices is okay.
/// * raystore: similar to marked, except it only stores a single ray per each spot on the mesh
/// (by its index), as well as a boolean that notes whether or not there is a ray in that spot
/// at all. This is populated by cbet, which chooses a random ray when there are multiple rays
